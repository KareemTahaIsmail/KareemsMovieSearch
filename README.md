With the help of TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/), I created a movie search engine with the use of JQuery and Vanilla JavaScript only.
All functions & styling were done from scratch.

To any of my future employers, the registration system for a user was working perfectly, with ReactJS, but couldn't seem to deploy the project online.
